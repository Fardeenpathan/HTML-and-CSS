               <p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. 
                   The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”),
                    who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612.

               <p>Colosseum, also called Flavian Amphitheatre, giant amphitheatre built in Rome under the Flavian emperors. 
                   Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime between 70 and 72 CE during the reign of Vespasian.
                    It is located just east of the Palatine Hill, on the grounds of what was Nero’s Golden House.</p>

           <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. 
               Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.”
                They proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. 
               Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later.</p>
